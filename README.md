# PracticeForNeoflex
The first experience of using java with spring. <br>
This project contains two integer methods: plus(a, b) and minus(a, b) and the ability to view the results of the calculator while the program is running is implemented.

To simplify the use of the API, Swagger was connected to this project.<br>
